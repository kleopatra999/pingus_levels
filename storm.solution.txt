The main insight is that you can build a bridge through teleportation portals.

First, build a bridge over the very deepest point of the flooded walkway. Build a bridge on the right side of the rightmost iceberg, connecting it to the spike as a wall. Due to the crevasse in the iceberg, incoming penguins will stay safely in this area.

Jump one penguin onto the platform with the igloo. It will be teleported to a point near the top-left corner of the map, but you are facing left, toward darkness and monsters. Turn around by mining a tunnel to the left until you hit undiggable rock. At the right end of the platform, build 3 bridges, the second passing through the glowing portal, and the third reaching the exit platform. Let this penguin exit.

Finally, use your last bridge from the top of the lower iceberg to the left, sending the collected penguins on their way.
