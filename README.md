# Pingus levels

This repository contains some levels I have created for the game [*Pingus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingus). You can obtain the game from [the *Pingus* website](http://pingus.seul.org/welcome.html) or from your operating systemâ€™s package manager.

Some of the levels are accompanied by `.solution.txt` files, which describe the intended solution. These obviously contain spoilers.
