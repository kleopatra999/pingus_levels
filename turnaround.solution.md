Use the one free penguin to get past all but the last obstacle:

0. Use a Basher to cut part-way through, aborting using a Slider.
0. Bridge over the toxic sludge, reaching the vertical wall.
0. Mine to the left, stopping before you hit the lava.
0. A thin layer of diggable rock covers a hard surface. Use a Digger at the marked location. Due to the slope, the hole has a higher right face (too high for penguins to walk over) than left face (which they can walk over), creating a barrier.
0. Dig at the two marked points: dig the right one first, allow the penguin to climb out, and then dig the left one. The undiggable ground will end each pit at a depth where penguins can climb out only to the right. (Digging only once, at the midpoint between the marks, may also work.)

At the last obstacle, use Blocker as the penguin reaches the end of the platform. Release the other 49 penguins using a Basher, and wait for them to pass the Blocker. Finally, rescue the Blocker using a Jumper; it will jump over the toxic sludge, bounce off the vertical wall, and land safely on the platform facing the other direction.
